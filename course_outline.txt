Course Description
Computer organization is a fundamental topic for computer science students and for any future programmers. The coursegives a good understanding of the computer hardware and how software is built on a specific hardware. The
computer isregarded as a hierarchy of levels, each one performing some well-defined functions from the device level (hardware) to theproblem-oriented language level. Each level is discussed and analyzed in detail.
Course Learning Outcomes/Competencies
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
Analyze and diagram the layered-architecture of a modern computer.
Explain the basic concepts and terminology related to Computer Architecture and Organization.
Discuss and compare modern machine architectures.
Apply theories related to internal functional units to the performance analysis of various machine architectures.
Explain and describe the characteristic of CPU architectures currently in use.
Explain the integration and operation I/O devices and their impact on overall machine performance.
Solve problems related to the performance and design of various computer architectures.
